-   In Jinja2, the | character is known as the pipe operator. It is used to apply filters to variables. 
    Filters are functions that modify the value of a variable. For example, in the statement customer.first_name | title, 
    the title filter is applied to customer.first_name, capitalizing the first letter of each word.
